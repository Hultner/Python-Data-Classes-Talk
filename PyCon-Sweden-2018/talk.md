## Title
Data Classes, in Python 3.6 and beyond

## Conference
Pycon Sweden, December 12, 2018 (10:45-11:20), Stockholm

## Talk Format
Presentation, 35 minutes

## Description
Python 3.7 is here and the @dataclass-decorator is a major new feature 
simplifying class-creation. In this talk, we will learn to use the power of 
data classes to make our codebases cleaner and leaner in a pythonic way.

We will also learn how to use the backport in Python 3.6 codebases before 
upgrading.

## Audience Level
Intermediate, intended to be interesting for all audiences.
